## Pet Adoption App built with React & Vite

This app was built during Brian Holt's course "Complete Intro to React, v8," which available on Frontend Masters. I had intended to start with his intermediate React course, but this one covered things I had not used before:

- Configuring the app from scratch without "create-react-app"
- Vite as build tool
- Create and use a custom hook
- Install and run ESLint & Prettier for testing style & format
- Use React Dev Tools on Chrome
- Writing and using a Class component
- Setting up Error Boundaries
- Making and using a Portal for a modal
